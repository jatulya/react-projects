1. created React app
2. Deleted unnecessary files
3. Created a nav bar
4. Created Components folder and added two components ->
    - Board
    - Keyboard
5. The Board is represented in the form of a matrix. This matrix is created using 
   another file named Words.js
   ?? Why are some files written under Components folder and others directly under src??
6. Another file named "Letter.js" is created. This file rn contains a small code to display 
    the letter at the required place
7. In App.js, we imported context api and imported the state board and the setBoard to
 all the child components which would make the child components access them .
zuseand
8. We then create Keyboard and Keys Components. Keyboard displays a virtual keyboard. 
    The keys are stored in arrays and keyboard display is done through mapping the three arrays 
    in three rows. Enter key and backspace key are written separately.
9. Keys Component does the main work. When the user clicks on the keys, they have to be 
    displayed or funtioned accordingly. That work is done here.
10. We write the functions in App.js and import it to the children components using context api
11. In Keyboard component, we call useEffect and useCallBack to add the event listener of keys 
    pressing from the keyboard and do the functions accordingly
12. Add appropriate colorrings to the letter positions to identify if they are correct or almost 
correct (green) or wrong(red).
13. Create a .txt file that contains different five letter Words
14. create an asynch function that generates a set out of the wordbank
