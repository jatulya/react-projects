1. created React app
2. Deleted unnecessary files
3. Created a nav bar
4. Created Components folder and added two components ->
    - Board
    - Keyboard
5. The Board is represented in the form of a matrix. This matrix is created using 
   another file named Words.js
   ?? Why are some files written under Components folder and others directly under src??
6. Another file named "Letter.js" is created and from here we take value from the user
7. In App.js, we imported context api and imported the state board to all the child components
