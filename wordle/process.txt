1. created React app
2. Deleted unnecessary files
3. Created a nav bar
4. Created Components folder and added two components ->
    - Board
    - Keyboard
5. The Board is represented in the form of a matrix. This matrix is created using 
   another file named Words.js
   ?? Why are some files written under Components folder and others directly under src??
